# Earpro Cover

Ear Protection is necessary in any scenario where firearms are being shot. However, they tend to be a bit uncomfortable. This earpro cover will give you both a cushy pad to space your head out from the band of the earpro, and will let you customize your earpro with whatever color or camo pattern you see fit. The  Modifications section contains additional changes to this pattern that can provide routing for cable management, a nametape slot to identify your earpro from others, an attachment loop if you need to hand your earpro from something, and some cute animal ears just for show.

## Materials

Additional materials may be needed for modifications, detailed in the *Modifications* section

- 500D Cordura, at least 9.5"x13"
- Tex 68 Thread
- Sew-on Hook Tape, 1.5"x8.5"
- Sew-on Loop Tape, 1.5"x8.5"
- Spacer mesh, at least 9.5"x 3"

## Steps

1. Cut your fabric to the 9.5"x13" rectangle provided in the pattern.
2. Press the outer 1/2" (marked on the pattern) inwards towards the "wrong" side of the fabric.
3. Press each of the other two dashed lines inwards towards the "wrong" side of the fabric. Unfold these two flaps once pressed, and lay the fabric facing "right" side up. Orient the fabric so when facing the fabric, the smaller flap (labeled "acessories" on the pattern) is to your left. 
4. Align your loop tape section at the rightmost edge of the fabric, in the space labeled "LOOP HERE" on the pattern. Pin or clip it in place
5. Stitch the loop tape in place by stitching a box 1/8" inside the edge of the loop tape.
6. Cut your spacer mesh to the 9.5"x3" rectangle labeled "SPACER MESH" provided in the pattern
7. Pin or clip the outer 1/2" (marked on the pattern) inwards towards the non-hole-filled side of the fabric. this may be difficult. ensure that the final size of this rectangle after the edges are folded is 2"x8.5"
8. Stitch a box 1/4" inside the edge of this rectangle. This will retain the raw edge of the space mesh and keep it hidden.
9. Lay the spacer mesh 1/2" to the left of the loop tape you stitched in step 4, such that it aligns in the space marked "MESH HERE" on the pattern. Pin or clip it in place.
10. Stitch a box inside the spacer mesh, right overtop of your previous stitches. This will attach the spacer mesh to the earpro cover fabric. If you are not using a heavy-duty machine you may have to sew this slowly or crank your machine by hand.
11. Align your hook tape section 1.5" from the left edge of the fabric, such that it is aligned in the space labelled "HOOK HERE" on the pattern. Pin or clip it in place.
12. Stitch the hook tape in place by stitching a box 1/8" inside the edge of the hook tape.
13. If you wish to include any accessory modifications, now is the time to stitch them on. 
14. Flip over your fabric and fold the two flaps you pressed in step 3 inwards. ensure their edges line up and there is no "wrong" side of the fabric visible throughout the entire piece. Pin or clip the flaps in place.
15. Stitch the two outer edges of your piece, 1/4" from the edge.
16. Stitch along the edges of the two flaps, 1/14" from the edge on either side.

Your earpro cover is now complete! Test fit it on your earpro and enjoy!

## Modifications

There are several modifications that can be made to this design depending on your use case. All of them may be added to this design at once, but they have some overlap such that you will need to add them in a specific order, and alter the instructions if you are combining them. Read the end of each modification section for the combination instructions. Make sure you read the full instructions for each modification you plan to add.

### Nametape Slot

Nametapes are an easy way to label your gear. This modification will add a loop field to the top of your earpro cover so you can put a hook-backed nametape on it. This modification may be combined with the Cable Management and/or Attachment Loop modifications. See the final portion of this section for changes that will make this combination possible.

To add this modification you will need:

- Sew-on Loop Tape, at least 1"x5"

To make this modification, execute the following steps during step TODO of the main earpro cover instructions:

1. Mark the center point of the section of the pattern labelled "accessories".
2. Pin or Clip the 1"x5" loop tape segment centered on the "accessories" section
3. Stitch a box 1/8" inside the loop tape segment.

To combine this modification with the Cable Management modification, instead make the Loop Tape segment 1"x**6"** (6" long, rather than 5"). This loop tape will replace the cover strap for the elastic loops. Stitch on the elastic loops first, then stitch on the loop tape, which should cover the raw ends of the elastic loops.

To combine this modification with the Attachment Loop modification, TODO. 


### Cable Management

Some forms of earpro have cables for microphone and PTT systems. These cables can be bulky and get caught on things, and this modification provides some additional cable routing options.

To add this modification, you will need:

- Elastic Webbing, 1"x10"
- 500D cordura, 9.5"x2"

To make this modification, execute the following steps during step 13 of the main earpro cover instructions:

1. Press the outer 1/2" of this cordura strip in towards the "wrong" side,  
2. Cut your elastic webbing into 2" segments. Wick the edges with a lighter to ensure they do not fray.
3. For each 2" elastic segment, fold the segement in half. Sew a running stitch 1/4" from the raw edge of the elastic.
4. Align each of your five elastic segments with the looped (non-stitched) edge facing the leftmost edge of your fabric. Space them out so they are 1/4" apart from each other, and centered vertically on the leftmost edge. See the "TEMPLATE FOR CABLE MANAGEMENT" for their placement within the "ACCESSORIES" section of the main pattern, they should be aligned with the striped fields. Pin or clip them in place
5. For each elastic segments, stitch a 1/4" wide zig-zag stitch overtop of the running stitch you made in step 3. This will attach the elastic segments to the fabric of the earpro cover.
6. Lay the cordura strip aligned and centered in the "ACCESSORIES" section. It should cover the stitched ends of your elastic segments, but leave the looped end of them exposed. There should be 1/2" of your elastic segments exposed. Pin or clip The cordura strip in place.
7. Stitch along each of the long ends of the cordura strip, 1/4" inside the edge. Take it slow when you are stitching through the elastic segments.
8. Finish the remaining steps of the earpro cover, Step 15 will effectively stitch down the short edge of the cordura strip.

To combine this modification with the Nametape Field modification, you will use a 1"x6" strip of loop tape in place of the cordura strip. See the Nametape field section for more details.

To combine this modification with the attachment loop modification, stitch on the attachment loop overtop of the elastic loops between steps 5 and 6 of the Cable Management instructions.

### Attachment Loop

TODO

### Cute Ears

These ears provide no tactical advantage, but they do look cute. See the "Cute Ears" guide in this folder for the different types of ears you can add, and instructions on how to add them.

To combine this modification with any of the previous modifications simply stitch the ears on once all other modifications are complete.
