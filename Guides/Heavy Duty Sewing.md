## MANDATORY: Your Work Saves Lives, and Can End Them Too.

**IF YOU ARE GOING TO READ ANY PART OF THIS DOCUMENT, READ THIS SECTION.**

As someone interested in producing tactical gear, you are responsible for your clients' safety. Your materials, techniques, and products are directly linked to people living or dying if they get into an actual combat scenario. This may seem like over-the-top paranoia but please understand, this is a very real warning and if you do not respect it, you will eventually learn the hard way.

For example, let's say you produce a plate carrier for someone. Your client is expecting the plate carrier to hold their plate in the proper position, keep their gear and pouches steady, and be something they can wear for long periods of time during an engagement.

If you get poor quality materials, or your stitching is not up to snuff, or the pattern you choose is not well designed, the plate may not hold the correct position. If your client takes a round, and the plate is not in the correct position, the plate will not be able to protect your client from taking a round to their vital organs, and dying.

If the PALS webbing is not properly aligned, stitched, spaced, and made with proper materials, it may fail under stress. This may result in your client's magazine pouch flopping around or falling off, or creating unnecessary strains on the magazine, ultimately resulting in the client not being able to draw a magazine when they need it. And when your client cannot draw a magazine quickly enough, their enemy may shoot first and kill your client.

If the plate carrier is stitched wrong, you don't finish your edges properly, or it's constructed uneven, your client may take unnecessary stress and strain. The client may fidget and be distracted by the plate carrier if bunched threads and unfinished edges are constantly digging into their skin. The client's dominant arm may be weakened by taking more weight than their non-dominant arm from an uneven carrier, making weapon handling more difficult. These will make your client less effective in combat, and less likely to survive, specifically because of your failure to produce a quality plate carrier.

In short, a plate carrier, and to an extent all tactical gear, is safety gear. It is intended to ensure that the user stays alive and maintains combat effectiveness. Any failure on your part as a producer can have real-world consequences that may result in death. Cutting corners here and there may not seem like a big deal but the little things can quickly become a huge problem. Furthermore, people who _think_ their poor-quality gear is well made will have a false sense of security. They will believe that their gear will support them in dangerous scenarios that it very much will not. Do not lie to your clients, if you are not ready to accept that your gear may result in someone's death, _do not sell your gear._ **Do not fuck around when making gear that is intended to keep people safe and save their lives**.

## Why Milspec?

Military specifications do not necessary make something _better_, but they do make it more _consistent_. When you work with milspec materials, you will know for a fact that no matter what you buy, if it complies to the spec it will have certain consistent traits. This is important because using mystery-meat materials without a clear spec can result in the manufacturer cutting corners and decreasing the overall effectiveness of the material. In addition, non-spec materials may have traits you're not aware of, that may prove problematic or even hazardous.

In general, **please** work within existing specifications for your materials. These specs exist for a reason, and that reason is to provide consistency to _keep people safe_. You do not want the gear you made to fail someone when their life is in danger. If someone dies because you skimped out on material, their blood is on your hands.

## Materials

For each material listing, the following information will be stated:

- Military specification: look this up on everyspec.com if you want more information on what this means
- Necessary traits/keywords: This is what you should look for when searching for this material.
- Use case: These are the scenarios you should use this material in
- Needle Size [for threads]: This is the size of needle that will match the thread size, otherwise you may have trouble creating well-formed stitches while sewing.

### A-A-59826 Type II - #69/Tex 70 Bonded Nylon Thread – Heavy-Duty items – Size 18 Needle

69 Weight/Tex 70 bonded nylon is the industry standard for tactical gear. This thread is made from multiple nylon threads and a protective coating which prevents fraying. It has a phenomenal breaking strength (9 lbs!), you will likely not be able to snap this with your hands.

### A-A-59826 Type II - #46/Tex 45 Bonded Nylon Thread – Heavy-Duty items – Size 14 Needle

46 Weight/Tex 45 bonded nylon may be used in a pinch for home sewing machines specifically. In general, I would _always_ recommend using Tex 70 thread, but some machines have problems feeding thread that large. Be aware that Tex 45 thread has a breaking strength of 6 lbs whereas Tex 70 has a breaking strength of 9 lbs. Your stitching will be weaker if you use Tex 45 rather than Tex 70.

### A-A-52094A Type I - Tex 50 Soft Spun Cotton Thread - Clothing items – Size 16 Needle

This spec of thread is used for clothing items, such as uniforms. This thread is sturdy, but cannot take anywhere near the same abuse as bonded nylon. This thread is softer and more flexible than bonded nylon. **Only use this thread for clothing items, do not use it for tactical gear**. For reference, this spec of thread has a breaking strength of 2.2 lbs, _significantly_ less than all previously mentioned threads.

### MIL-DTL-32439 - 500D Cordura/Ballistic Nylon Fabric - Heavy-Duty items

The D in 500D stands for Denier, a measurement of the thread thickness used to weave the fabric. 500D has been proven to work excellently compared to 1000D cordura, another common milspec standard. This fabric is chosen specifically for its abrasion, heat, and water resistance. As the denier decreases, the abrasion resistance gets worse, but the water resistance, weight, and flexibility of the fabric improves. You may think that it's always best to make your gear out of extremely high-denier fabric, but this will result in your gear being excessively heavy, stiff, and uncomfortable. 500D should be your first pick in general for heavy duty items, only opting for 1000D fabric when extreme durability is required. Cordura is the brand name for this type of fabric. Get properly-rated cordura where you can, mystery ballistic nylon may not meet spec. Fabrics that are not 500D and 1000D may also not meet spec and be as durable as is safe, please stick to 500D and 1000D unless you know what you're doing. **Higher Denier does not mean "better"**.

### MIL-DTL-43637E - 50/50 Nylon-Cotton (NYCO) Ripstop Fabric - Clothing Items

This spec is used for clothing items. The fabric is reinforced with a grid of thicker threads in the weave of the fabric. These threads minimize ripping, as the thicker threads will keep a tear from increasing in size like it would in normal fabric. Ripstop is lighter and more flexible than Ballistic Nylon, but lacks the same abrasion and water resistance traits. This makes it better for high-flexibility applications like clothing items, where if abrasion and water resistance are required, the wearer can simply put on another layer of clothing that has those traits. **Only use this fabric for clothing items, do not use it for tactical gear.** Be aware: 50/50 Nyco has been known to melt and drip when exposed to flames. 50/50 Nyco fabrics with fire-retardant (FR) coatings are greatly preferred in scenarios where flames may be present. Nomex & Aramid fabrics are better suited to FR roles, but those are outside the scope of this document at this time.

### MIL-W-17337F – 17337/MOLLE/PALS Nylon Webbing – Heavy-Duty items

This spec of nylon webbing was originally intended to be used at 1" width for PALS webbing (often called "MOLLE" webbing, but PALS specifically refers to the host gear item, MOLLE refers to the pouch). It is more flexible than 17337 spec webbing. It also comes in other sizes, but these should not be used for PALS webbing as they do not meet the size spec for PALS. For other uses they are perfectly fine.

### A-A-55301 – 55301 Nylon Webbing – Heavy Duty, Load-Bearing items

This spec of nylon webbing was originally intended for the straps of ALICE rigs but has since been updated. It is now commonly used in belts, slings, and other load-bearing gear. It is stiffer and thicker than 17337 spec webbing, but has a decreased breaking strength.

### MIL-T-5038 Type III – Grosgrain Binding Tape - Heavy-Duty items

Binding tape is folded over the raw edges of some gear to protect the wearer and keep the edges from fraying.

### A-A-55126 - Sewable Hook Tape/Fabric (Velcro) - General Use

This is the "hook" side of hook and loop. This should be used on the moving side of what needs securing (i.e. the flap of a pocket, the back of a patch). The brand name is velcro, but many non-brand-name version still meet spec.  **Do not use adhesive-backed hook and loop tape if you intend to sew it**, the adhesive may coat your needle and slow down or damage yourmachine.

### A-A-55126 - Sewable Loop Tape/Fabric (Velcro)- General Use

This is the "loop" side of hook and loop. This should be used on the stationary side of what needs securing (i.e. face of a pocket, the spot on a garment you want to put a velcro patch onto). The brand name is velcro, but many non-brand-name version still meet spec.  **Do not use adhesive-backed hook and loop tape if you intend to sew it**, the adhesive may coat your needle and slow down or damage your machine.

## Tools

### Sewing Machine [Heavy Duty Preferred]

A good sewing machine is necessary to produce any tactical gear with meaningful strength. Hand sewing has its benefits but in the world of Cordura, Webbing, and Bonded nylon, a machine is the way to go. You may be able to sew with a standard home sewing machine (see #45 thread above), but a heavier duty home sewing machine is _heavily suggested_. Punching through multiple layers of heavy-duty fabric and webbing is difficult for standard machines.

Look for a machine with a steel frame if possible. I'd personally suggest Singer's Heavy Duty (HD) line, with the cheapest model (The HD 4411) costing $170 at time of writing. The other machines in that line do not have many appreciable differences other than providing more stitch options, which you will not use for heavy-duty sewing.

Ensure your machine at minimum can perform a straight stitch and a zig-zag stitch. These are _necessary_ to produce any tactical gear. Make sure the machine can take universal needles, otherwise procuring needles may prove difficult.

Industrial sewing machines are several times more powerful than any home machine, but cost several times as much. They also often can only do one specific type of stitch, so you may need multiple industrial machines to replace your one heavy duty home sewing machine.

### Needles

Ensure that you have proper needles compatible with your sewing machine, in proper sizes corresponding to your threads. Improperly sized needles may fail to penetrate the fabric, break or create issues with the thread. See the Materials section for suggested needle sizes. Needles need to be replaced often to ensure they are sharp and unbent. Switch your needles out every 8 hours of sewing or after you have completed a project. I have had many problems with my sewing machine that could not be solved with adjusting tension and timing, where just changing the needle solved everything.

### Iron

An Iron is an extremely useful addition to your toolset. Pressing folds into your fabric ahead of time can greatly help your ability to maintain straight seams and clean lines.

### Pins or Clips

Pins are used to hold fabric in place while sewing clothing items, whereas clips are more effective with heavy-duty items. Pins tend to bend when rammed through multiple layers of cordura, so clips are preferred. Small binder clips work, but there are also brands of clips targeted specifically for sewing purposes. I prefer those, personally.

### Chalk Pencil (sewing pencil)

A chalk pencil will help you lay out a pattern on your fabric before cutting it, and provide guide lines for sewing and pressing fabric. I consider this a vital tool.

### Ruler

A ruler will help you draw on and fold your fabric, doing it by eye will create imprecision. A standard ruler will work perfectly fine, but I prefer a transparent quilting ruler, mine is 4"x 14" and has ¼" marks throughout. I use this extensively when designing patterns, and the width makes it easier to maintain square corners.

### Measuring Tape

A soft measuring tape is useful both for measuring your clients when making clothing, and measuring oddly-shaped gear to either create patterns off of it, or to ensure it matches an existing pattern.

### Vertical Spool Stand

You do not necessarily need to buy a commercial product for this, but spools of mil-spec thread are _large_, _very large._ A stand is necessary to ensure the spool can rotate freely as the machine draws thread off of it. I'm going to be honest when I don't have a proper stand, I just use a bottle of whatever alcohol I have on hand, it usually works pretty well.

### Seam Ripper

Everyone makes mistakes, and a seam ripper undoes them. A sturdy seam ripper is necessary to fix any issues with your sewing, please make sure you have one on hand.

### Scissors

Technically, you only need one set of scissors. Grab any decently sharp set of scissors with a tip that actually snips and you should be good. However, there are multiple cutting implements that prove very useful when sewing that I would suggest if you have the money. These are by no means mandatory.

#### Dedicated Fabric Scissors

If you grew up with a mother that sewed, you are likely familiar with her having a Specific Special Set Of Scissors that you were not allowed to touch. This is for a reason. Having extremely sharp and dedicated fabric scissors is invaluable, they can glide through fabric, making the cutting part of sewing far easier. Be warned: do not use these on cordura or other heavy-duty fabrics if you can help it, they are often coated or treated with chemicals that may dull your scissors over time.

#### Snips/Nippers

A small pair of sharp scissors are perfect for trimming thread off a workpiece, and snipping small corners of fabric. I always have a set right next to my sewing machine.

#### Rotary Cutter

A rotary cutter uses a sharpened wheel of metal to allow you to cut fabric on a cutting mat (if you're buying a rotary cutter, please buy a cutting mat as well. Your table will thank you). These prove valuable when cutting long, straight lines in fabric. I like to use them when cutting out traced patterns, as well as when designing patterns. Be aware that they aren't as precise as scissors, and may cut further than expected on corners.

#### Lighter
Any old lighter will do. You will use this lighter to pass the flame over fraying webbing, and the ends of threads. this will cause the material to slightly melt, sealing the edge/thread.

## Best Practices

### Backstitching

The start and end of a stitch are the weakest points, because the thread can slip out over time. Backstitching prevents this. When you start a stitch, stitch from the edge forwards a half-inch, then press the reverse button on your machine and stitch backwards until you are at the edge again, and then continue your stitch forwards until the end of the stitch. Then reverse again for a half-inch, and continue to the edge again. This ensures that the start and end of the stitch is locked in place, and the thread just can't wiggle its way out. Ensure that your stitches overlap so this actually works as intended.

### Wicking Thread Ends

When you've trimmed off your workpiece from the thread still attached to the sewing machine after completing a stitch, you are often left with little stubs of thread at the start and end of your stitch. When stitching with bonded nylon, trim these stubs down to about ¼", and then pass the flame of a lighter over the stubs. The stubs should heat up and melt slightly, receding until they become little blobs of plastic sitting on the seam. This will further help prevent the thread from slipping its way out from the fabric. Be careful not to light your fabric on fire, or light excessively long threads.

### Pressing Your Fabric

When sewing, try to press your folds with a hot iron ahead of time. Sometimes clips and pins cannot consistently hold the fabric in the right shape, and pressing will help reduce the amount of work they need to do to hold the shape.

### Straight Lines

This may seem obvious, but stitching straight lines is important. If you stitch a curved or wiggly line, when stress is applied to that stitch, the stress will affect the stitch and fabric unevenly. This means that the thread or fabric may be more likely to break in specific areas. When stress is applied evenly across your thread and fabric, there are no specific weak points for the stitch to fail at.

### Consistent Stitch Length

This is similar to the previous point. Maintaining consistent stitch length ensures that there is no one area of your workpiece that receives more strain than another, increasing the overall reliability of your product.

### Proper Thread Tension

Properly tensioning your thread can be difficult with heavy-duty materials, but stitches that have a loose top or bottom thread are far weaker than a properly-tensioned thread. If such a loose thread gets snagged on something, improper tension means that the entire thread may be pulled right out from your product, causing the entire stitch to fail at once.

### Proper Stitch Theory

This point is a bit more abstract, but it is important to understand where and why some stitches are used. Specifically, Zig-Zags, Bartacks, and Box-X stitches are extremely important to ensuring a workpiece can properly handle load. The patterns this guide provides will have specific instructions on where to use them, and this guide [in the future] will attempt to discuss their proper usage. These stitches exist for a reason, don't just think a single running stitch can solve everything.

For a window into what the science of stitch theory looks like, skim through "[A STUDY OF PARACHUTE SEAM DESIGN CRITERIA](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0110406.pdf)" by Charles R. Miller. His tests utilized old specs of webbing and thread, but the science behind how different stitch patterns can handle stress still holds up.
